# Recommendation System

This project implements a recommendation system designed to provide personalized recommendations based on user-item interactions. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and suggest items accordingly.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluating the recommendation system.
  - `dataset.csv`: The dataset file with user-item interactions or relevant features.

- **models/**: Contains the model definition for the recommendation system.
  - `model.py`: Defines the classes and functions for building, training, and evaluating the recommendation algorithm.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
  - `analysis.ipynb`: Used for exploratory data analysis and visualization of the dataset.

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the recommendation system.
  - `main.py`: The entry point of the application, orchestrating the workflow of the recommendation system.
  - `preprocess.py`: Functions for preprocessing the dataset, including data cleaning and transformation.
  - `recommend.py`: Functions for generating recommendations based on the trained model.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project, including libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd recommendation-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the recommendation system, execute the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```

This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and generate recommendations based on user input.
